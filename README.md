# Leader Election in Adaptive LLM Agent Groups

**Simulation and analysis of leader election dynamics in adaptive LLM agent groups (GPT-5, GPT-4, LLaMA-3).**

Code for controlled experiments on **voting behavior, network centrality, and fairness** in AI-driven multi-agent systems.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository provides the simulation framework, experimental protocols, and analysis tools to study leadership emergence in groups of autonomous LLM agents.

### Key Features
- **Three experimental conditions**: Full election (nomination + discussion + voting), direct voting, and random baseline.
- **Metrics**: Vote distribution, centrality analysis, speaking order diversity, and initiative effects.
- **Models**: GPT-5-mini, GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA-3-70B.
